## Description
Tiny Theme is developed for use with the Micro.blog platform. It is designed to be as fast as possible while still supporting all features of the platform and popular plugins. It is the easiest theme to customize on the platform and the first to use Microhooks.

**Demo and Docs:** [tiny.micro.blog](https://tiny.micro.blog).
